# AUTOMATIC-DOOR-LOCK-SYSTEM-WITH-RFID-SENSOR
Prototype For Automatic Door Lock System With RFID Sensor
I created a smart door-lock system using RFID technology and Arduino microcontrollers as the transmitter and receiver for door locking and unlocking. I was responsible for both the code and hardware. Input from the device is acquired through an RFID sensor, which properly scans the unique ID card.
# Required Components
1. Arduino Mega 2560 or Arduino Uno
2. RFID Module
3. Micro Servo
4. Keycard
5. LCD
