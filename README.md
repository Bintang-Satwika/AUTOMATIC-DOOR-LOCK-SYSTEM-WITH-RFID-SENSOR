# AUTOMATIC-DOOR-LOCK-SYSTEM-WITH-RFID-SENSOR
Prototype Automatic Door Lock System With RFID Sensor
created a smart door-lock system using RFID technology and Arduino microcontrollers as the transmitter and receiver for door locking and unlocking. I was responsible for both the code and hardware. Input from the device is acquired through an RFID sensor, which properly scans the unique ID card.
